Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a generalist, full-stack engineer. I'm into: collaboration, learning new things,
software as craft, and digging into interesting problems. Recently I've been in the
GIS space both in and out of work because I love the visibility the domain affords,
and think spatial reasoning is at the core of many of the world's problems.

Zooming out, I've shipped a lot of things across a pretty big range of domains,
and worked with a ton of different people to get those things across the finish
line. While I'm happy to lead projects, collaboration really is my bread and butter. âœ¨

Got an interesting problem and think you'd like to work with me on it? Reach out!
