I'm a full-stack software engineer that likes learning new things and collaborating! Other things I like: software as craft, clean interfaces, command lines, slick code AND boring code.

I've shipped a lot of things across a pretty big range of domains, and worked with a ton of different people to get those things across the finish line. âœ¨

Got an interesting problem and need someone to lean in on it? Reach out!
